This is homework 05 from Lucy Mei.

# Homework05: Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene
## Goal
1. Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

2. Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.

3. Implement visualization design principles.

4. Write some data to file and load it back into R. e.g. save a plot to file and include it in a R markdown report via ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png).

5. Organize my github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545.

## For this homework I am going to use gapminder
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Factor management
Step goals: 
- Define factor variables;
- Drop factor / levels;
- Reorder levels based on knowledge from data

### Drop Oceania
1. Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania.
```{r}

```
