# My experience
Although I am in science, I don't have a strong stat background. Before I attended this class, I knew nothing about R. I only learned Python during my undergrad. At first, I prefer Python because I think coding of Python is more user-friendly and I can play many tricks. As I learn more about R, I understand why R is more widely used for data analysis and manipulations. Knowing how to use R is definitely an asset for my future study.
